</b></b></font>

<p>These are my notes from the initial session. </p>
<b> The Internet:  </b>  HTML documents contain the content for the web.  
The user's specific web browser translates this code into digestable, 
aesthletically appealing visual and auditory information. Servers contect 
computers via HTTP requests sent by user's computers.<br>
<p> <b> HTML: </b> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is currently in its 
fifth version. Most of the files on the web are written, at least in part,
in HTML. I am typing text content right now, whereas markup commands enable
special formatting, such as bolds, italics, spaces, etc.
</p>
<p> <b>Tags & Elements: </b> HTML documents are comprised of HTML elements,
which are written with a start tag, with an end tag, and with the
content in between.</p>

<p> <b> Computers Respond to Instructions Literally: </b> If there is 
an error in a program, it is due to the programmer's code, not the computer
itself.  Non-artifically intelligent computers only respond to humans' 
commands.

<p> <b> Inline vs. Block Elements: </B>  Most HTML elements are defined
as block level elements or inline elements.  Block level elements
normally start (and end) with a new line.  An "invisible box" forms around
the content of a block element.  Inline elements are normally displayed
without line breaks.
